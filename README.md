Personal Goals
==============

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get work done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals (for my trial run until September 1st
1. Overcome my addictive patterns when it comes to media (stop watching TV altogether)
2. Overcome my lack of self-discipline in other areas of my life
3. Make a large amount of headway in my Flatiron Online education
 

4. Join a variety of social groups whether developers or not
5. Learn Japanese at a steady pace using Japanesepod101
 

6. Learn how to cook
7. Work on my overall health, whether diet or exercise
8. Work on side projects as I have time
